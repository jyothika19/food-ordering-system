# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you want more control over the build tool and configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you can customize them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts.

You don't have to use `eject` if you don't want to. The default setup is suitable for most small to medium projects.
